{"name":"Termenu","google":"","body":"Abstract\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTermenu is a command line utility and Python library for displaying console\r\nbased interactive menus.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTraditionally there are two types of applications running the Unix shell: pure\r\ncommand line utilities such as grep, sed and awk and full screen interactive\r\napplications such as Midnight Commander. Termenu aims to bridge this gap and\r\nallow a modicum of interactivity in regular command line utilities. A common\r\nexample is finding and editing a file located somewhere in the directory tree.\r\n\r\nThe usual way to do this is to run::\r\n\r\n  $ find . -name \"*.py\"\r\n\r\nThis will shown a list of files in the current directory and its\r\nsub-directories::\r\n\r\n  ./lib/keyboard.py\r\n  ./lib/ansi.py\r\n  ./termenu.py\r\n\r\nNow you need to write a command to start the editor, using the mouse (gasp!) to\r\ncopy and paste the required filename to the command line, like so::\r\n\r\n  $ vim ./lib/keyboard\r\n\r\nIn its simplest use-case, termenu allows you to choose one or more of the lines\r\nyou pass to it in an interactive way. The following command will allow you to\r\nchoose one or more of the files returned by the ``find`` command::\r\n\r\n  $ find . -name \"*.py\" | termenu\r\n\r\nA simple modification will start the ``vim`` editor with the selected files::\r\n\r\n  $ vim `find . -name \"*.py\" | termenu`\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n::\r\n\r\n  termenu [items] [options]\r\n  \r\n  --help                Show help message\r\n  -f FILE, --file=FILE  Take menu items from a file\r\n  -d OPTION, --default=OPTION\r\n                        Default item to select\r\n  -h N, --height=N      Max height [10]\r\n  -o, --one             Don't show a menu if only one option was given\r\n  -p, --precolored      Preserve ANSI coloring in supplied options\r\n  -i, --inline          Show small inline menu on a sinel line\r\n  --single              Single selection only\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nShow the contents of a recent commit in ``git``::\r\n\r\n  $ git show `git log --oneline --color | termenu -p | awk '{print $1}'`\r\n\r\nAsk a multiple choice question::\r\n\r\n  $ echo -n \"Would you like to exit? \" && ./termenu -i Yes No Maybe\r\n\r\nSee Also\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIf you like termenu, you may find `gitter <http://github.com/gooli/gitter>`_\r\ninteresting as well. It's a termenu based git client that acts exactly like the\r\nstandard command line git but shows a menu whenver appropriate. It's similar to\r\nhow git works under zsh, but works with standard shells and has smarter menus.\r\n\r\nName\r\n----\r\n\r\nOh, and if you were wondering, termenu is a combination of the words *terminal* and *menu*.\r\n","tagline":"A one line menu for use in command line scripts on Unix-based terminals","note":"Don't delete this file!
